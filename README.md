# CS4511-Project\

## Frontend 
1. run ```yarn``` inside the fronend folder to install all the dependencies used
2. run ```yarn``` start to start the application
3. Open an emulator or scan the QR code generated with your mobile device

## Backend
* The backend is deployed and nothing is required to serve the backend

## Limitations
* Some screens are not updated even if the actions are triggered due to state management limitations. State management tools like Redux were not used because of different contraints.
* The generated backend is not as efficient and relys heavily on the user's internet speed.

## Current Functionality 
* The current beta app is a MVP with the basic functionality implemented. 
* Please see our 
[summary of current and future planned functionality](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L3WJTeaYOTAFdTasxIm2gyLDChdrjDAYzYYHyHLfDfg/edit?usp=sharing) for details and justifications of our current implemented app.
