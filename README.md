# CS4511-Project

## Backend
* The backend is deployed and nothing is required to serve the backend

## Frontend
* run ```yarn``` inside the fronend folder to install all the dependencies used
* run ```yarn start``` to start the application
* Open an emulator or scan the QR code generated with your mobile device


## Limitations
* Some screens are not updated even if the actions are triggered due to state management limitations. State management tools like Redux were not used because of different contraints.
* The generated backend is not as efficient and relys heavily on the user's internet speed.
