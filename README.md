## Front end 
1. run yarn inside the fronend folder to install all the dependencies used
2. run yarn start to start the application
3. Open an emulator or scan the QR code generated with your mobile device

## Backend
### Running the backend server
1. Navigate to the backend folder `cd backend`
2. If you are running the backend for the first time run `npm install` inside the backend/functions directory.
3. To run the backend execute `firebase serve` from inside the backend folder.

## Limitations
* Some screens are not updated even if the actions are triggered due to state management limitations. State management tools like Redux were not used because of different contraints.
* The generated backend is not as efficient and relys heavily on the user's internet speed.

## Current Functionality 
* The current beta app is a MVP with the basic functionality implemented. 
* Please see our 
[summary of current and future planned functionality](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L3WJTeaYOTAFdTasxIm2gyLDChdrjDAYzYYHyHLfDfg/edit?usp=sharing) for details and justifications of our current implemented app.
